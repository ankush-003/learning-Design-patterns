Adapter pattern works as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces. This type of design pattern comes under structural pattern as this pattern combines the capability of two independent interfaces.

[two ways](https://www.baeldung.com/java-adapter-pattern) to implement the adapter pattern:
- `Class Adapter Pattern`: This form uses multiple inheritance to adapt one interface to another.
- `Object Adapter Pattern`: This form uses object composition to contain the interface that needs adapting.
