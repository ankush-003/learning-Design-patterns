# SOLID Principles
SOLID is an acronym for the first five object-oriented design (OOD) principles by Robert C. Martin. These principles are a set of guidelines that help software developers design maintainable and scalable software.

The five SOLID principles are:
- **`Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)`**
- **`Open/Closed Principle (OCP)`**
- **`Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)`**
- **`Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)`**
- **`Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)`**

## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
The Single Responsibility Principle states that a class should have only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job or responsibility.
- A class should have only one reason to change.
- A class should have only one responsibility.

## Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
The Open/Closed Principle states that a class should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- A class should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- A class should be easily extendable without modifying the class itself.
