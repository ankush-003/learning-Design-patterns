# Behavioural Design Patterns
Behavioural design patterns are design patterns that deal with the assignment of responsibilities between objects. They help in defining how objects interact in a loosely coupled way and can provide flexibility in carrying out communication.

## Types of Behavioural Design Patterns
- **`Chain of Responsibility`**: A way of passing a request between a chain of objects.
- **`Command`**: Encapsulate a command request as an object.
- **`Iterator`**: Sequentially access the elements of a collection.
- **`Interpreter`**: A way to include language elements in a program.
