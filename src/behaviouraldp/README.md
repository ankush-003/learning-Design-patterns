# Behavioural Design Patterns
Behavioural design patterns are design patterns that deal with the assignment of responsibilities between objects. They help in defining how objects interact in a loosely coupled way and can provide flexibility in carrying out communication.

## Types of Behavioural Design Patterns
- **`Chain of Responsibility`**: A way of passing a request between a chain of objects.
- **`Command`**: Encapsulate a command request as an object.
- **`Iterator`**: Sequentially access the elements of a collection.
- **`Interpreter`**: A way to include language elements in a program.

The Chain of Responsibility pattern is used to achieve loose coupling in software design where a request from the client is passed to a chain of objects to process them. Each object in the chain will decide either to process the request or to pass it to the next object in the chain. The chain of objects will have a common interface to process the request and a reference to the next object in the chain to pass the request
